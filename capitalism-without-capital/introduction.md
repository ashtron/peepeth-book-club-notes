# Introduction

- “The investment element of GDP is where the animal spirits of the economy bark, and where a recession first bites.”
- business valuation has been traditionally done by measuring the value of tangible assets
    - but a company always has intangible assets (and **the proportion of intangible to tangible assets has been growing**), e.g. stansted airport’s “complex software; valuable agreements with airlines and retailers; internal know-how”
        - e.g. microsoft’s market value in 2006 was $250bn, while its balance sheet would suggest a valuation of $70bn; intangible assets made up the (huge) difference
- the study of intangible investment has exploded in the past 10-20 years
- “Our **central argument** in this book is that there is something fundamentally different about intangible investment, and that understanding the steady move to intangible investment helps us understand some of the key issues facing us today: innovation and growth, inequality, the role of management, and financial and policy reform.”
    - “We shall argue there are **two big differences with intangible assets**.
        - 1. most measurement conventions ignore them. There are some good reasons for this, but as intangibles have become more important, it means we are now trying to measure capitalism without counting all the capital.
        - 2. the basic economic properties of intangibles make an intangible-rich economy behave differently from a tangible-rich one.”

### Measurement: Capitalism without Capital
- measuring intangible investment is not often done because it’s very difficult
    - “as such investment starts to exceed tangible investment, [these omissions] leaves larger and larger areas of the economy uncharted”

### Properties of Intangibles: Why the Economy Is Becoming So Different
- intangible investments tend to be **sunk costs**
    - “Intangible assets are harder to sell and more likely to be specific to the company that makes them”
- “The tendency for others to benefit from what were meant to be private investments—what economists call **spillovers**—is a characteristic of many intangible investments”
- intangible assets tend to **scale** better
- intangible investments tend to have **synergies** (complementarities)

- “Because intangible investments, on average, behave differently from tangible investments, we might reasonably expect an economy dominated by intangibles to behave differently too.”
- “the shift to intangible investment helps us understand **four issues of great concern** to anyone who cares about the economy:
    - secular stagnation
    - the long-run rise in inequality
    - the role of the financial system in supporting the nonfinancial economy
    - the question of what sort of infrastructure the economy needs to thrive”
