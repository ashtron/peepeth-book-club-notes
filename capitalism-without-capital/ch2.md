# chapter 2: capital’s vanishing act
- in this book when we talk about “**investment**” we are not talking about the buying or selling of pieces of paper on a stock market or households paying university tuition. Rather, we are talking about spending by business, government, or the third sector that creates a **fixed (i.e., nonfinancial) asset**, that is, resources spent that create a long-lived stream of productive services. We shall call such a fixed asset providing these long-lived productive services “**capital**.” Because both capital and labor produce such productive services, economists refer to them as "factors of production."
- a patent is an example of an **intangible asset** because it “arose from a process of production, [was] acquired or improved by producers, and [provides] a benefit over time” but was created through intangible investment (“the work of scientists in a lab”)

### Reasons for the Growth of Intangible Investment
- because “the productivity of the manufacturing sector generally increases faster than that of the services industries…labor-intensive services become more expensive relative to manufactured goods” (Baumol's cost disease)
    - “most tangible investments are manufactured” while intangible investments “depend much more on labor,” so “over time, we would expect intangible investment spending to gradually rise relative to tangible”
- “New technology also seems to be increasing the opportunities for businesses to invest productively in intangibles,” e.g. Uber’s driver networks enabled by smartphones
    - as tangible investment in IT increases, so does intangible investment
