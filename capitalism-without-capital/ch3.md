# chapter 3: how to measure intangible investment

### What Sorts of Intangibles Are There?
- three basic categories of intangible investment
    - **computerized information**: “any investment that involves putting information into computers to make them useful in the long run,” e.g. software
    - **innovative property**: mostly R&D
    - **economic competencies**: three main types
        - marketing and branding
        - organizational capital (e.g. business models and corporate cultures)
        - training specific to the company

### Measuring Investment in Intangibles
- three steps to measuring investment
    - 1. find out how much firms are spending on the intangible
    - 2. adjust spending to measure investment, since “not all of that spending will be creating a long-lived asset”
    - 3. adjust for inflation and quality change “so we can compare investment in different periods”
- “To measure in-house spending, statisticians imagine there is a software or R&D or training ‘factory’ inside the firm and try to measure how much spending it takes to run that ‘factory.’”
    - next they determine “how much of that spending will last for more than a year,” which gives us the nominal investment
    - adjusting for inflation and quality gives us the real investment
